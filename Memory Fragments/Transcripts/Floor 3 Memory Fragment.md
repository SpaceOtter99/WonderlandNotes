[Evienne delivers a killing blow to a monster.]

  

VYRNON: So… this is the strength… of the [[Evienne|First Dreamer]]… I must submit…

EVIENNE: Hah… hah… that was exhausting.

GWYNETH: We did it, though! [[Count Vyrnon|Vyrnon]] down, [[floor 10]] cleared! Holy shit, Ev, we’re halfway!

ALIA: That we are.

EVIENNE: Um, Alia… what did he mean by the [[Evienne|First Dreamer]]? That’s not the first time we’ve heard that. I’m certain even you’ve said that to me before.

ALIA: I suppose you’re ready to hear this. Gwyneth, Edbert, you may want to listen in as well.

GWYNETH: Oh?

ALIA: Evienne, I told you from the beginning that the dream is here to answer someone’s cry for help. Thing is… that cry for help is yours. You are the [[Evienne|First Dreamer]] that the dream built itself around. ^96fd50

EVIENNE: I’m… the [[Evienne|First Dreamer]]?

ALIA: Whatever waits in the [[Floor 20|Deep Dream]], it’s a monster you have to overcome. On the plus side, as you progress through the dream, you’re gaining more power. This is your dream, after all - by the time we reach the [[Floor 20|Deep Dream]], you’ll have enough control over it to do… well, anything.

GWYNETH: Do anything? Like a god?

ALIA: Pretty much. She’ll get to the point where her desires can be manifested into physical form… like dreamcraft, but instead of just customising her weapons, she can customise the whole dream as she sees fit.

EVIENNE: That’s… that’s impossible. So it’s my cry for help that made this place? What did I need help with?

GWYNETH: I mean… you said it yourself, right? You didn’t have very many friends before me.

EVIENNE: None, really. I suppose this makes sense, though. Throughout the whole dream so far, I’ve been feeling like I’m just an instrument of someone else’s will. Now I know - it’s my own will.

GWYNETH: I guess we’ve got to keep going then. Whatever’s in the [[Floor 20|Deep Dream]] is your greatest fear or something, right?

ALIA: It will be, yes. I shudder to think what’s waiting for us.

GWYNETH: Well, I don’t have godlike powers, but I’ll take every advantage I can get, so long as it helps you, Ev. We’ll do this together.

EVIENNE: We will. We need to learn more about the lower ten floors… things are only going to get more dangerous from here.

  

[A sparkling sound can be heard.]

  

GWYNETH: We’re waking up. Guess that makes sense, having beaten the boss monster and all.

EVIENNE: I’ll see you at school, Gwyn!

  

[Evienne and Alia fade away.]

  

GWYNETH: …There we go. Am I, uh, gonna wake up soon, too? Wait, that’s-

  

[Gwyneth walks over to a nearby wall.]

  

GWYNETH: More writing on the wall. ‘Only you are smart enough to help me. We will speak soon, and I will give you the power to help her.’ Well, I’ve befriended a lot of monsters, Edbert… looks like another one wants to help out. Anything for Evienne! ^2bc55a

  

[Gwyneth begins to wake up, and the sound of cooking fades in, alongside pencil scribbling.]

  

GWYNETH: Thanks for having me over, Mrs. Murdoch.

MURDOCH: Oh, please don’t worry about it. It’s lovely to see Ev having friends over. I hope you’re revising hard!

EVIENNE: We are, mum. At least, I think we are.

GWYNETH: Why’d you look at me when you said that?

MURDOCH: Alright, I’m going to finish up tea. It’ll be another ten minutes, girls.

EVIENNE: Thanks, mum.

  

[Mrs. Murdoch walks out of the room, and the scribbling continues. Eventually, Gwyneth sighs.]

  

GWYNETH: God, I hate biology. What’s the mitochondria?

EVIENNE: The powerhouse of the cell.

GWYNETH: Oh. I got that for cell wall. What’s the cell wall, then?

EVIENNE: Good heavens, Gwyn, you’re hopeless. Here’s my sheet. I think I’ve got it all right.

GWYNETH: You probably have. You’re decent at basically every subject.

EVIENNE: I just focus more. And anyway… I owe you one.

GWYNETH: You what?

EVIENNE: I… never really thanked you, but I’m really glad we met, Gwyneth. Both in and out of the dream, you’ve been a great friend over the last few months.

GWYNETH: God, don’t give me that, Ev. You’ve been a good friend too - this street goes two ways. No need to thank me, alright?

EVIENNE: Alright.

MURDOCH: Ev! Can you lay the table?

EVIENNE: Coming!

  

[Evienne stands up to leave.]

  

GWYNETH: I noticed, though. Alia hasn’t been shadowy since we met.

EVIENNE: …I noticed that too. That’s all your doing, you know.

GWYNETH: Bah, I didn’t do nothing. I’ll come help once I finish this sheet.
