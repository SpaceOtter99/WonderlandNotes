[A monster’s roar can be heard.]

  

EVIENNE: Alia! Darkness damage!

  

[Alia slashes through the monster, which gives a last gasp as it crumbles into dust.]

  

GWYNETH: Huh… Alia saves the day again. That was a near thing.

EVIENNE: This floor’s a huge step up. And we haven’t even seen hide nor hair of the boss monster yet.

GWYNETH: Yeah, the [[floor 7|seventh floor]] isn’t fucking around, is it? Ow…

EVIENNE: You suggested splitting up to check out those two offices, didn’t you? Do you want to wait until we have stronger weapons?

ALIA: It’s a shame there’s no powerful monsters in this dream.

EVIENNE: What do you mean, Alia?

ALIA: There’s some mighty monsters known as adversaries. If you can obtain items from them, they can lead to some powerful dreamcrafted weapons. But it doesn’t seem like this dream has any, from what I can tell.

GWYNETH: That’s annoying. I’m sure this morningstar can have a few more upgrades! Guess I’ll just have to use what I’ve got. ^7ce4da

ALIA: Can you handle yourself, Gwyneth?

GWYNETH: I’ll be alright. You go check out the other office - see you later. Ev.

  

[The sounds of footsteps can be heard.]

  

GWYNETH: Hey, Edbert. Do you think we’re… OK?

  

[Beat.]

  

GWYNETH: Strong and silent like always, huh? No, don’t worry. Everything’s fine. It’s just… Evienne seems to be way stronger than me. And Alia, too. The dream seems to come so naturally to them.

  

[Edbert sits by Gwyneth, but does not speak.]

  

GWYNETH: I just wish I could help more. I wasn’t doing anything useful during the fight with Abbadon, and we would’ve died if it weren’t for Alia. What if the monsters start getting too strong? What if… I can’t keep up?

  

[Edbert looks at Gwyneth with worry.]

  

GWYNETH: I really wish you could fucking talk to me, sometimes! I’m just going around in circles in my own head!

  

[Gwyneth begins walking away, furious. The footsteps suddenly stop.]

  

GWYNETH: ‘If you wish to be strong, find me in deeper dreams than this.’ Who… wrote this..? ^8c5bd5

  

[The sound fades away, to be replaced by the noises of school.]

  

EVIENNE: Um, Gwyneth, are you doing OK? You seemed a little off in the dream last night.

GWYNETH: Oh, yeah, I wouldn’t worry. Just getting a bit pissed off that I’m not as strong as you. I wanna help more, you know?

EVIENNE: You are a big help, Gwyn! I wouldn’t have made it this far into the dream without you.

GWYNETH: Alright, alright, don’t lay it on too thick. Oh, actually, that reminds me. Have you ever seen… writing on the wall, in the dream? ^a1a186

EVIENNE: Writing on the wall?

SCHOOLGIRL: Hey, Gwyneth! So, I heard Jason went out with a friend this weekend, and someone said you knew who he was with.

GWYNETH: Oh, Dawn, I don’t wanna be the bearer of bad news. He told you he was with Blake, didn’t he?

SCHOOLGIRL: Uh, yeah?

GWYNETH: I heard from Sal that he was actually with Mary. They went to the pictures together.

SCHOOLGIRL: What?! I’m gonna kill him!

  

[Evienne steps over to Gwyneth as the schoolgirl rushes off.]

  

EVIENNE: Sal didn’t say anything like that to you. I was sat behind you when you were talking to her in maths.

GWYNETH: Well, OK, that was a little white lie. But Jason cheated on his last girlfriend, and I don’t wanna see Dawn go through that. May as well break them up now before he does actually cheat.

EVIENNE: You… just say what you need to? To make things work out like you want?

GWYNETH: People come to me for information, so I got used to… you know, tweaking info here and there. When you’re the person everyone comes to for the truth, it’s easy to lie.

EVIENNE: See, this is exactly what I mean. You don’t need the dream - you practically rule this school, Gwyn. I have… well, I have one friend, counting you. I don’t know anyone here. I’m just the strange girl who spends every lunchtime drawing in the art room.

GWYNETH: If they knew what a force you were in the dream, they’d be clamouring to be your pal. Out of fear, probably, but hey, whatever works.

EVIENNE: It is a shame nobody else knows about the dream. With Truth and Techne in hand… (sigh) I wish people could recognise what I’m capable of. But nobody will know. ^02ee5d

GWYNETH: I know, and I think you’re pretty cool. Who needs other people, right?

EVIENNE: Easy for you to say. You seem to know everybody in our year.
