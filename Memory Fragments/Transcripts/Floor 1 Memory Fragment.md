[There’s a movement, as if someone is shifting from foot to foot.]

  

ALIA: Are we moving on, Evienne?

EVIENNE: We’ve got to wait for Gwyneth. I don’t want to run afoul of that angry boss monster again.

ALIA: I suppose you’re right. I think she’d take us out in one hit right now.

  

[Beat.]

  

ALIA: It is nice that you made a friend in the dream, though. I was worried it’d just be us for the entire thing. Not that I wouldn’t mind that, but I worry about you at school.

EVIENNE: Oh, y-you don’t need to worry. We became friends in the real world, too! She, um, comes to sit with me at lunch sometimes. It’s… very strange, finally having someone to talk to.

GWYNETH: Heyo! Didn’t keep you waiting, did we?

EVIENNE: Oh! No, we’ve not been waiting long. Ready to explore the [[floor 3|third floor]]?

GWYNETH: Hell yeah. I’d like to get rid of all the monsters infesting my house!

  

[The girls prepare to leave, and footsteps can be heard.]

  

GWYNETH: God, it’s sweltering.

ALIA: No kidding. Stay alert - that werewolf is probably skulking around here somewhere.

GWYNETH: Hey, Evienne, I’ve been meaning to ask. Familiars are based on a real-world object, right? Like how my Edbert is based on one of my Boglins?

EVIENNE: Yes, that’s right.

GWYNETH: What’s Alia based on, then? She just looks… like you, but shining with light. You could pass for twins.

EVIENNE: O-oh! Um, well, there is a reason for that. How about I show you what I used to make Alia tomorrow at school?

ALIA: I’m sure you’ll like it.

GWYNETH: Alright, I’ll hold you to that. Ooh, might take this chain with me. Bet I can dreamcraft this into some kind of chain-morningstar!

EVIENNE: Is… is that a real thing?

ALIA: I don’t suppose it matters in the dream.

  

[The sound fades away, and the sound of chattering and paper can be heard.]

  

GWYNETH: Hey, Ev! Thought I’d find you in the art room.

EVIENNE: You’ve come to see what I promised, then?

GWYNETH: ‘Course! I’d have been a bit earlier if I hadn’t run into Blake. He was banging on about wanting to go on a date with me again.

EVIENNE: That, uh, seems to happen a lot with you. You’ve always got guys following you around.

GWYNETH: I could have any guy I wanted, and that power’s almost intoxicating. Sometimes I might lead ‘em on a bit too much, but it’s just a bit of fun.

EVIENNE: Oh. That doesn’t sound very fun for them.

GWYNETH: If they don’t want me to mess with them, they ought to leave me alone. Besides, you’ve probably done the same, right?

EVIENNE: I hardly think so. I’m not really the type to get dates, unfortunately.

GWYNETH: What? That’s crazy. You’re so pretty, though!

EVIENNE: Um, if you say so… uh, anyway, here it is - Alia.

GWYNETH: Whoa! Did you draw this?

EVIENNE: Yes. It’s a self-portrait of me… it was for a homework task last year. Before all of the anxiety set in. Alia took form from this, and she reflects how I view myself. ^aa7a23

GWYNETH: Huh… is that why she’s sometimes all glowy and light, and sometimes shadowy?

EVIENNE: I… I don’t always feel good about myself. Alia sometimes reflects that.

GWYNETH: Oh, I didn’t mean to… hey, look, Evienne. We’re gonna totally slam the [[floor 3|third floor]] tonight. Alia hasn’t been shadowy in a few weeks now!

EVIENNE: You’ve only known me a few weeks, Gwyn. She’s like that a lot… you’ll see.**
