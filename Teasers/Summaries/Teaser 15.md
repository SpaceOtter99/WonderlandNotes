Filename: Wonderland Teaser 16

Theme: #adversaries

[[Red Text]]: Adversaries, They aren't supposed to be here

A row of known adversary silhouettes, with the text:
```
What exactly are adversaries?
They're even stronger than boss monsters. Terrifying creatures created from the darkest of human desires. But...
But what?
We saw the First Dreamer's memories. There were no adversaries in the dream originally. They aren't supposed ot be here.
```

This sounds like an interaction between a #dreamer and their #familiar. It also mentions the [[Evienne|First Dreamer]].
