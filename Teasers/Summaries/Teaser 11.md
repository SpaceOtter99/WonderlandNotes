Filename: Wonderland Teaser 14

Theme: #wrong #death #captain

A darkened, writhing ocean, with text reading:

```
Captain, we're taking on water!
Dammit, mates, hold the line! We won't let her sink us!
Oh, god, it has ANOTHER HEAD!
Stop screaming and FIGHT, Norris!
Run, captain!
A captain always goes down with the ship!
```

Upon brightening the image, extra text is revealed:

[[Red Text]]: Scylla

```
Captain Bonny!
Hecksam, grab on! We'll get out of this!
It was a mistake to ever try hunting Scylla.
Falkland!
```

This gives us a number of new names: [[Captain Bonny]], [[Hecksam]] and [[Falkland]]. This teaser also implies that the mythical Greek sea monster Scylla will make an appearance in the dream - potentially also implying an appearance by Charbydis.
