Filename: Wonderland Teaser 17

Themes: #captain #wrong 

A picture of a figure that resembles Ameyri, wielding an axe, with the following text:
```
The Captain? Well, she's...
complicated
murderous
brave
protective
misguided
It depends on who you ask, really.
```

Likely referring to [[Captain Bonny]], from [[Teaser 11]]. Given the figure is a white silhouette we know to be female, this could well be an alternate appearance of [[Braided Girl]] or [[Straight Haired Girl]]
