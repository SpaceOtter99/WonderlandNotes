Theme: #deal 

A white hand reaching out to touch a black hand, with the text
```
Ah, the forgotten noble. You must be so exhausted...
I am... so tired... but-
-but you can't give up. I know. You have run yourself ragged tryign to achieve this goal.
I must do as he asked...
Let me be the man to ease your pain. let me take over.
You..? Your voice is... familiar...
Do we have a deal?
```

The obvious implication here is that this is one of the dreamers making a deal with the ragged man. However, using the character colourings, this could in fact be [[Braided Girl]] making a deal of some kind with [[Man]] (given the height difference)
