Theme: #dream 

An empty corridor reminiscent of hospitals/offices, with two elevators and writing on the wall reading:
```
Do you read me?
Only you can read these messages.
You're the only one smart enough to help me.
```

We see many examples of [[Gwyneth]] reading writing on the wall in the dream:

We know from past experiences that this related directly to a monster in the dream - although previously this related to the dreamer discovering more about themselves, with the messages being vaguer and more threatening.
