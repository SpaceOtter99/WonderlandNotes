Filename: Wonderland Teaser 13

Themes: #death #familiar 

A dark image of an animalistic creature holding two swords whilst stood on a zebra crossing outside of a theatre. Text reads:

```
The boss monster of the thirteenth floor is... indisposed. Don't worry dreamers, a replacement will be with you very soon!
```

We can infer this creature to be [[Leofric]] from matching in-game descriptions. In much darker text at the bottom, you can read:

```
Meteor impact in 50 turns
```

A brighter version of the image can be seen here:
