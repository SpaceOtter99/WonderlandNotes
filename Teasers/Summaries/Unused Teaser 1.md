Filename: Wonderland Teaser 8

Theme: #adversaries 

[[Red Text]]: Adversary

The TV-headed adversary, with the text:

```
What the hell was that?!

That was an adversary.

But that doesn't make any sense. 

The First Dreamer was very clear about one thing.

There are no adversaries in this dream.
```

Mentions the [[Evienne|First Dreamer]]. Sounds like a conversation between two people, perhaps [[Gwyneth]] and another person? Or possibly a separate party hearing the memory fragments.
