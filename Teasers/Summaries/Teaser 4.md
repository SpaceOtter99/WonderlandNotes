[[Red Text]]: Save someone ^14ec6d

Filename: "Wonderland teaser 4"

Theme: #dream #wrong 

Features a short-haired boy, hunched over, with the text:
```
You were brought here to save someone
```

Pose mirrors that of [[Teaser 1]]. 

Additional text is partially visible in the background. Occluded elements written as (???):
- [[Mama]]'s changed
- Everything is a lie
- I don't want to hurt them
- is Dad lying to (???)
- Why hasn't (???)fric come back?
- What (???) sup(???) (???)nherit?
- Why won't she leave me alone? (Potentially [[Mama]])
- someone's watching me

We can extrapolate a few of the missing parts:

- What am I supposed to inherit?
- Why hasn't [[Leofric]] ( #familiar ) come back?
